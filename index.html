		<h2> Our founder </h2>
		<img class="avatar"src="images/jia.JPG" alt="Jia Kalra">
		<p> Artisans Collective was founded by Essec Business Student, Jia Kalra. She aimed to build a platform where customers looking for high quality, one of a kind products would be able to come into contact with local artisans. Following the rise of mass manufacturing and large corporation, arts that have been around for centuries are being forgotten and artisans are being forced to give up their crafts. Artisans Collective hopes to revive these crafts by offering convenience to customers. </p>
